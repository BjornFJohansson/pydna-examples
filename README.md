 N.B. Mybinder runs on infrastructure paid for by the [Freeman lab](https://www.janelia.org/our-research/former-labs/freeman-lab).
Please do not abuse the service. If you want to do extensive testing of these notebooks, it is better to download this repository 
and run the notebooks locally (it will also be faster).
