This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and data files 
that demonstrate how [pydna](https://github.com/BjornFJohansson/pydna/blob/py3dev/README.md) 
can be used to plan, document and simulate cloning experiments. 
The links below open a static version of each notebook as a web page directly in Github.

* Construction of the [YEp24PGK_XK](simple_examples/YEP24_PGK_XK.ipynb) vector using restriction and ligation.

* Construction of the [pGUP1]("simple_examples/pGUP1.ipynb") sequence using _in-vivo_ homologous recombination

* Assembly of the 32 [Mumberg expression vectors](mumberg_32_expression_vectors/mumberg_32_vectors.ipynb)

* Assembly of the [pGreenLantern-1](pGreenLantern1/pGreenLantern1.ipynb) sequence.

* Expression of the [Strawberry aat gene](strawberry_aat/strawberry.ipynb) in _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ using the Yeast Pathway Kit

* Gibson assembly example [Gibson](gibson/gibson.ipynb)

## Static notebooks

Static versions of the notebooks can also be displayed as 
web pages through [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/BjornFJohansson/pydna-examples/blob/master/index.ipynb).

## Dynamic notebooks

Click on the red and black "launch binder" image above to run the notebooks on the cloud service [Mybinder](http://mybinder.org/).
This way notebooks can be executed online without having to install anything on the users computer.

N.B. Mybinder runs on infrastructure paid for by the [Freeman lab](https://www.janelia.org/our-research/former-labs/freeman-lab).
Please do not abuse the service. If you want to do extensive testing of these notebooks, it is better to download this repository 
and run the notebooks locally (the notebooks will also run faster).

## Notebook served from dropbox

Example of a notebook located in a [dropbox folder](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1263722/served_from_dropbox.ipynb
). A notebook in a public dropbox folder is not indexed by search engines such as Google, so if there are no links to it, it will remain hidden.
